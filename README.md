# Dijkstra's self stabilization algorithms
As part of a presentation for Distributed Computing Seminar, I made this simulation tool for Dijkstra's self stabilization 3rd algorithm that can be found here:
http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/ewd04xx/EWD426.PDF

The third algorithm is about the 3-state machines.
My lecturer usually teaches only the first algorithm so I added the option for the first algorithm of Dijkstra as well 
so next he can demonstrate while teaching. 

This simulation tool helped me understand Dijkstra's proof for the 3rd algorithm.

# The Program

After opening the program N=0 and no processors exists:

And after entering value for N, the processors will be arranged in a ring with random state:

Also can be displayed as a string:

And draw the arrow mentioned in his proof:

Also there are some more button to create specific configuration and etc...
